# NeetCode-Grind

Welcome to the NeetCode-Grind repository! This repository is a collection of code solutions to various LeetCode problems as part of our journey to master coding interview questions. We are following a structured roadmap to ensure we cover all essential topics.

## Roadmap

We are following the NeetCode roadmap which covers several important topics such as:

- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack
- Binary Search
- Linked List
- Trees
- Tries
- Backtracking
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

## Solutions

The solutions are organized by topic and are available in the respective directories. Each solution includes the problem statement, the approach taken, and the code implementation.
